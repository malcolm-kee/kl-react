### For Patient Seeking Help

1. Follow our [Code of Conduct](/code-of-conduct).
1. Bring your laptop so you can show others the code and the part that is causing your headache.
1. If it's a work project, seek the approval/confirmation from your superior before the session. If your company policy does not permit that, create a sample/reproduction in [CodeSandbox](https://codesandbox.io/) to illustrate the problem _in advance_.
1. Ask help from any doctor that is not helping others courteously. We will help you how to identify who registered as a doctor. However, feel free to ask anyone nearby to discuss on your problem.
