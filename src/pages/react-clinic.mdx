## Rules

### For Patient Seeking Help

1. Register yourself by stating your intention to join during RSVP in Meetup.com.
1. Follow our [Code of Conduct][coc].
1. Bring your laptop so you can show others the code and the part that is causing your headache.
1. If it's a work project, seek the approval/confirmation from your superior before the session. If your company policy does not permit that, create a sample in [CodeSandbox](https://codesandbox.io/) to illustrate the problem _in advance_.
1. Ask help from any doctor that is not helping others courteously. We will help you to get a doctor if possible. However, feel free to ask anyone nearby to discuss on your problem.
1. Be considerate if your doctor refuse to help you or wish to leave the session. They may want to help others, or interested in the tech talk.
1. If you are not comfortable of the behavior of your doctor (e.g. open another program without consent, open non-related folders), please voice out your concern to the doctor or any member of organizing committee.
1. Feel free to help others if you think you can contribute. Just make sure you follow the rules for doctors below.
