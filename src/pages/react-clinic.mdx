# React Clinic

Get diagnosis of your code that is causing you headache.

Everyone is welcomed to give help/suggestion. You would be surprised that how often a solution would emerge automatically when you ask question. Don't feel that you have to be an expert to help.

## Rules

### For Those Seeking Help

1. Register yourself by stating your intention to join during RSVP in Meetup.com.
1. Follow our [Code of Conduct][coc].
1. Bring your laptop so you can show others the code and the part that is causing your headache.
1. If it's a work project, seek the approval/confirmation from your superior before the session. If your company policy does not permit that, create a sample in [CodeSandbox](https://codesandbox.io/) to illustrate the problem _in advance_.
1. Ask help courteously. We will help you to get a partner if possible. However, feel free to ask anyone nearby to discuss on your problem.
1. Be considerate if your partner refuse to help or wish to leave the session. They may want to help others, or interested in the tech talk. You can always look for another partner.
1. If you are not comfortable of the behavior of your doctor (e.g. open another program without consent, open non-related folders), please voice out your concern to your partner or any member of organizing committee.
1. Feel free to help others if you think you can contribute. Just make sure you follow the rules below.

### For Those Giving Help

1. Don't take over the keyboard without consent. Even if you get the consent, you should focus on the current code that has been shown. Don't open other program/files without seeking consent first. Respect others' privacy.
