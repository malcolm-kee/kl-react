title: Tech Referrals
---

We're opening up this initiative to connect Covid-affected tech job seekers with hirers. We have had the pleasure of working with organizations and recruiters that hosted our pre-Covid meetups. It's not a replacement for job application platforms, but it's a starting point to connect people.

Our objective is to cease operating this initiative after it has served its purpose.

## For Seekers

We're targetting experienced hires, fresh grads, and especially re-skilled individuals.

Drop your details at [Form for Seekers](https://forms.gle/76MmwQW7zm8XzToG8) and we'll reach out to you.

Showcase your personal projects so that we can pass it along too.

## For Hirers

We're looking to connect with hirers too. Recruiters, tech leads, startups, and anyone hiring for full-time (preferrably with health insurance) are welcome.

Drop us your email at [Form for Hirers](https://forms.gle/zeE42oz7Zafn9B6a9) to get connected. We'll reach out to you to understand the skill sets you're looking for.
