title: Meetup Checklist
---

## > 1 Month Before

### Theme

1. What is the theme? (Not compulsory but it would be great to have one)

### Talks

1. Check the speaker volunteer list in our Airtable
1. Ask anyone interested to submit the details [here](/submit-a-talk).
1. One of the organizing member to prepare a backup talk.
1. Decide the MC for the meetup.

### Venue & Food

1. How many people can fit into the venue?
1. Is security registration required?
   - If yes, what details are required? Full Name, Phone Number, IC Number? (As an organizer we try to collect as little as possible, so don't suggest if they never ask, because they would think "let's also collect that, just in case")
   - Set the RSVP question for the meetup event to ask for those details.
1. Is food sponsored as well?

### Marketing

1. Meetup event is created with date.
   - Set RSVP start date to 2 weeks before event, as those RSVP so early probably just book the slot without proper consideration.
